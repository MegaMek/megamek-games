# Stress Tests

These stress tests are done in similar environments to what is on these servers.
Done in a controlled environment with no observers. All conditions are reported
and the resulting log will be posted here for others to see the carnage.

## 2 Bots, 78 Units Each, 156 Total

Ran via public server ghost-bear.megamek.games set with 2G of ram. 3 total
connections, 2 Princess Bots in default config. Game Settings were adjusted
with most TacOps/StratOps settings turned on. Used 3 32x34 maps top to
bottom.

End Result: no crashes and many breaches.
