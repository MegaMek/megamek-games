# Stress Tests

These stress tests are done in similar environments to what is on these servers.
Done in a controlled environment with no observers. All conditions are reported
and the resulting log will be posted here for others to see the carnage.

## 12 Bots, 12 Units Each, 144 Total

Dedicated server given 8G of ram, 13 connections, 12 Princess Bots in default
config. Game settings were not changed. 2 Princess bots were assigned to each
team and given 12 units each to control. Mostly 'Mech's with a few vehicles
thrown in.

End Result: 1.9G of ram used, no crashes.
