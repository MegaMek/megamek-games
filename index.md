# MegaMek.games

The public servers below are provided by members of the community with a
commitment to keep them updated and cover the cost of running them.

If you have any issues with setup, or need more clairification, this site is
hosted on Github Pages. Please open an issue at it's [Repository](https://github.com/rjhancock/megamek-games).

## Public Servers

These servers are provided for the public to use. You MUST use the same version
posted to prevent errors from gameplay. List will be updated as servers are
added, removed, and updated.

## Be Polite

It happens at times that games will get disconnected or people will just stop playing mid-game for whatever reason. If you join a server and it looks like a game is in progress, use the chat and see if anyone responds. Give them a few mintues. If no one responds, feel free to `/reset` and start playing.
